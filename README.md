# Transactix: Web-Based POS and Inventory Management System

**Overview:** Transactix is a comprehensive and scalable web application meticulously designed to revolutionize retail operations. By seamlessly integrating Point-of-Sale (POS) and Inventory Management functionalities, Transactix empowers businesses to achieve unparalleled efficiency in product management, precise stock control, streamlined sales transaction processing, and the acquisition of invaluable insights through detailed sales history analysis.

**System Architecture:**

Transactix employs a modular and well-defined architecture, comprising the following core components that interact harmoniously to deliver its intended functionality:

1.  **Client (Browser):**
    * **Technology:** React (with Vite)
    * **Description:** The user interface is constructed using React, a cutting-edge JavaScript framework, enhanced by Vite for optimal development and build performance. This ensures a highly responsive and interactive Single Page Application (SPA) experience, tailored to the needs of both cashier and administrator users.

2.  **Laravel API Server:**
    * **Technology:** Laravel (PHP)
    * **Description:** The robust backend logic and a suite of secure API endpoints are powered by Laravel, a renowned PHP framework celebrated for its security features, developer-friendly ecosystem, and adherence to best practices. This server acts as the central processing hub for the application, managing:
        * **RESTful API Endpoints:** A well-structured set of API endpoints following REST principles, enabling secure communication between the frontend and backend. These endpoints expose the application's functionalities in a standardized and accessible manner.
        * **Sanctum (Authentication):** Implements a sophisticated token-based authentication mechanism provided by Laravel Sanctum. This ensures that user identities are rigorously verified, and all API access is securely protected. Upon successful login, users receive an authentication token, which is then stored (typically as a cookie or in local storage on the client) and included in subsequent requests.
        * **Controllers/Services:** Houses the core business logic of the application. Controllers receive requests from the API endpoints, and Services encapsulate specific business functionalities, orchestrating interactions with the data layer and other parts of the system.

3.  **Inventory Management System:**
    * **Location:** Resides within the Laravel API Server.
    * **Description:** This dedicated module focuses on the critical aspects of product and stock control, providing a comprehensive set of features for:
        * **Product CRUD:** Enables administrators to Create, Read, Update, and Delete product information efficiently. This includes essential details such as product name, detailed description, pricing information, and more.
        * **Stock Quantity Tracking:** Implements real-time monitoring and management of the available stock levels for each product, providing accurate inventory insights.

4.  **Cashiering System:**
    * **Location:** Also integrated within the Laravel API Server.
    * **Description:** This module handles all aspects of the Point-of-Sale (POS) operations, providing a user-friendly interface and robust functionalities for:
        * **POS Interface:** An intuitive and efficient user interface designed for processing sales transactions quickly and accurately. This includes features for easy product selection and seamless quantity adjustments.
        * **Payment Processing:** Manages cash payment transactions, including accurate calculation and display of the change due to the customer.
        * **Receipt Generation:** Generates professional and informative receipts upon the successful completion of a transaction. These receipts can be either printed for physical records or downloaded for digital archiving.
        * **Sales History & Logs:** Maintains a detailed record of all completed sales transactions, capturing crucial information such as the date and time of the sale, the specific items sold, and the total transaction amount. This data is invaluable for reporting and analytical purposes.
        * **Role-Based Access:** Implements a robust role-based access control mechanism, defining distinct user roles (e.g., Cashier, Administrator) with precisely defined privileges and permissions. This ensures that users can only access the features and functionalities relevant to their assigned responsibilities, enhancing security and operational efficiency.

5.  **Supabase Database:**
    * **Technology:** Supabase (PostgreSQL-based)
    * **Description:** A reliable and scalable cloud database service built on PostgreSQL that serves as the persistent storage for all of Transactix's critical data. The database is logically organized into the following key tables:
        * `products`: Stores comprehensive details for each product within the inventory.
        * `users`: Manages user accounts, including essential authentication credentials and assigned roles within the system.
        * `sales`: Records detailed information about every sales transaction processed through the system.
        * `receipts`: Stores the specifics of each generated receipt, linking them back to their corresponding sales transactions.
        * `sale_items`: Represents the individual product items included within each sales transaction, establishing the relationship between sales and products with associated quantities.
        * `categories`: Organizes products into logical categories, facilitating efficient product management and categorization within the inventory system.

**Data Flow:**

The client-side React application initiates communication with the backend Laravel API server through secure HTTP requests directed to the protected API endpoints. These requests typically include an authentication token to verify the identity of the user making the request. The Laravel backend diligently processes these incoming requests, performing necessary business logic and interacting with the Supabase database to retrieve or persist data. This interaction with the database is facilitated through Supabase's RESTful API and Laravel's database abstraction layer to streamline database interactions and enhance code maintainability.

**User Management:**

Transactix incorporates an internal user management system to meticulously control access and define permissions for all users interacting with the application. The user management workflow is structured as follows:

1.  **Initial Administrator Setup:** When a new organization adopts Transactix, the Transactix development team will manually provision an initial super-administrator account. This ensures a secure and controlled onboarding process.
2.  **Administrator User Creation:** Upon successfully logging in with the initial administrator account, the designated administrator within the organization gains the exclusive authority to create new user accounts for their employees directly within the Transactix system.
3.  **Role-Based Access Control:** The system is designed with predefined user roles, such as "Cashier" and "Administrator," each associated with a specific set of privileges and permissions tailored to their responsibilities. The administrator has the crucial ability to assign these roles to newly created users, effectively controlling their access to various features and functionalities within Transactix.
4.  **Credential Management:** Each user account created within Transactix is associated with a unique username and a secure password, both managed directly within the application. Administrators will have the necessary tools to manage these credentials, including the ability to reset passwords and control the status of user accounts (e.g., enabling or disabling access).

This internal user management system provides a straightforward and efficient mechanism for organizations to manage their staff's access to Transactix and maintain control over user permissions.
